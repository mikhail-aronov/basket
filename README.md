# Basket

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Usage
Enter an item name and quantity in the top header and click "Add New Item". The item will show up in the top section of the display.

Hover over or click a grocery list item to reveal options for adding to basket. Select quantity and click "Add to Basket". The item will show up in the lower section of the display.

Hover over or click a basket item to reveal options for removing from the basket. Select quantity and click "Remove from Basket". The item quantities will update in both the grocery list and the basket. 

If the entire quantity of an item is added to the basket, that item will be hidden in the grocery list (or crossed out if the "Show items added to basket" is checked). If a partial quantity is added, the item will appear in both the grocery list and the basket with the corresponding quantities. 

If the quantity added to the basket is removed, that item will no longer be visible in the basket.
